OCOA

[O]ptimal [C]ontrol based [O]bstacle [A]voidance algorithm

====

Model Predictive Control Based Vehicle-Dynamics-Conscious Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm

step 1: Run ADD_PATHS.m to add paths to the MATLAB path directory. 
        rootpath.m will be generated, which defines the path of the /OCOA folder.
		
step 2: Run COMPILE_CPP.m to compile the required c++ files.

step 3: Read the readme.pdf in the /examples folder, which is a note that explains the inputs to the simulation.

step 4: Try the examples included in the /examples folder.

step 5: Create test cases using the MAIN_template.m in the /examples folder.

step 6: When an error occurs during the simulation, a zip file with the name "error(date).zip" will be generated.
        Please email Jiechao Liu (ljch@umich.edu) the zip file for debugging purpose.
