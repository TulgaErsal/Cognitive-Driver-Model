This directory contains the ACT-R model of driver behavior, derived from the original LISP model (Salvucci, Human Factors, 2006).

The following steps are recommended for compiling and running the model:

* use Eclipse as the Java development environment
* start a new Eclipse project for the driver model
* add, as an external library, the ACT-R.jar file that comes with the Java ACT-R system
* add the model source code
* compile and run the system
* when the application launches, open the Driving.actr model and run the model

Note that the simple graphics simulation is used for real-time runs, whereas a scaled-down simulation is used for fast runs.
